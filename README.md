Developing and Building
=======================

If you want to hack on and build Comgen yourself, you'll need the following dependencies:

* libgtk-3-dev
* meson
* valac
* libgtksourceview-3.0-dev
* libsoup2.4-dev
* libjson-glib-dev
* libgranite-dev
* libgee-0.8-dev

Run `meson build` to configure the build environment and run `ninja test` to build and run automated tests

```
meson build --prefix=/usr
cd build
ninja test
```

To install, use `ninja install`, then execute with `com.github.jeremyvaartjes.ping`

```
sudo ninja install
com.github.jeremyvaartjes.ping
```
